#### 2. Slower processor speeds

Now let us see the better variants of these programms.

###### 1. Play store
Its the basic play store. It has onls the function of downloading apps. For the average user its enought.
There are tho a couple of better variants.\
[1. APKPure](https://apkpure.com/de/apkpure/com.apkpure.aegon/download?from=home&icn=aegon&ici=image_home&channel_id=1006)\
[2. F-Droid](https://www.f-droid.org/de/)\
[3. APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/apkmirror/apkmirror-installer-official/apkmirror-installer-official-1-3-2-17-5-release/apkmirror-installer-official-1-3-2-17-5-android-apk-download/)

###### 2. Google browser and Google chrome
Litterally a virus itself, theres sooo much better than the google browser and the chrome browser out there.
Not only is it slow, but its also unsecured.\
[You can download them independently on this application](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.marmaro.krt.ffupdater/)\
[1. Brave](https://brave-software-brave.de.uptodown.com/android/download)\
[2. Vivaldi](https://apkpure.com/vivaldi-browser-smart-swift/com.vivaldi.browser/download?from=details)\
[3. Thor](https://f-droid.org/packages/threads.thor/)\

[Other extra for image searching](https://tineye.com)

###### 3. Gmail
Gmail gets useless once you know the better versions of mail services.
Gmail does not have privacy by design like litterally every other GApp.\
Heres some better ones.\
[1. K-9 Mail](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.fsck.k9/)\
[2. Tutanota](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.tutao.tutanota/)\
[3. Protonmail](https://apkpure.com/proton-mail-encrypted-email/ch.protonmail.android)

###### 4. Google maps
Maps don't even need to be applications but can also be started on a search engine depending on which you use.
If you use the right map, your coords cannot be traced back from the app to the developper or/and democrat behind.\
Heres some better options\
[1. Open map](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.osmdroid/)\
[2. All-In-One Offline Maps](https://apkpure.com/all-in-one-offline-maps/net.psyberia.offlinemaps)\
\
you can also use search engine maps such as [Duckduckgo Map](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bern&t=brave&ia=web&iaxm=about)

###### 5. Google drive
Google drive is nothing else but a cloud.\
it does what it should except its google and they don't deserve more data from you to sell.\
[1. Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)\
[2. P-cloud](https://pcloud.com/)\
[2. kDrive](https://f-droid.org/de/packages/com.infomaniak.drive/)

###### 6. Google music
Very useless since you have usually a preinstalled Music player already\
But were here for the case you don't have that\
[1. Litterally a basic music player](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.musicplayer/)\
[2. Music player](https://apkpure.com/music-player-audio-player/media.music.musicplayer)

###### 7. Google videos and movies
You only pay for nothing usefull, the movies are visible on other websites made to be looked at\
so theres a website that isn't legal in certain countries (North korea and china specificly) which is called [bs.to](https://bs.to/).\
but on android theres apps that can be there to save certain movies with ratings.

[cinelog](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.ulicae.cinelog/)

###### 8. Google hangouts
Most unused app out there.\
but theres apps like Whatsapp that suck your data off too. so i give you a good list of usefull chats.\
[1. nextcloud talk](https://www.f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nextcloud.talk2/)\
[2. Threema](https://apkpure.com/threema-private-messenger/com.wa.threema) __note: the app costs at the beginning and should be first bought on play store.__\
[3. telegram](https://apkpure.com/telegram/org.telegram.messenger)

###### 9. Google images
litterally the most useless thing, theres not even a app needed to be installed on litterally any OS for already having something so much supperior than google images.


###### Extra
