## There are better roms than the preinstalled google samsung rom.

## Best alternative roms
**[1. Lineage](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/)**\
**[2. crDroid](https://crdroid.net/downloads)**\
**[3. OmniRom](https://omnirom.org/#devices)**\
**[4. CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/install/)** Only for Pixel

## TWRP
short for **Team Win Recovery Project** this file allows you to open certain phones\
**[Download TWRP's here](https://www.androidsage.com/2016/03/06/download-latest-twrp-3-0-0-for-your-android-device/)**\
Whitout TWRP you cannot unlock the [bootloader](https://github.com/pascal-gerber/Lineage-help/blob/main/Bootloader.md).\
The TWRP is an Interface for the bootloader that allows you to have also the bootloader unlocked for other Operation Systems.

## .zip and .img file for Alternative rom
You have to have the zip file ready to flash your phone with it.\
from those websites you can download the zip and the IMG both for flashing your phone.\
for Odin you have to use the .zip file, i recommand using Odin for flashing your ROM.\
for Heimdall you have to use the .img which i cannot do.

## Download mode
Accessing the download mode is different for every device.\
you have to access it tho on every phone while its offline.\
**To enable the Download mode you must:**
#### 1. Connect to a google account in order to unlock the ORM
#### 2. Activate your Developper options
By going on the:
1. **Settings ⚙️ **
2. **About tablet / About Phone**
3. **Software Information**
4. spamclick the **Build number** Label
#### 3. **Developer options** have been unlocked by then, open it
#### 4. Unlock OEM unlocking
#### 5. Activate USB debugging
#### 6. Search on the internet the **"device_name" download mode**
Since every device has different buttons and also different ways to unlock download mode.\
usually you have primary componnents to click at the same time or activate.

1. Turn on/off button
2. Sound up and down buttons
3. Menu button (phone middle button)
4. USB cable connected to a "computer" specificly (usually for phones that don't have the button anymore)

you just have to find the right combination of those\
There are also other factors sometimes that count

1. Battery at +80% or so
2. Heightest android version possible
3. Others i cannot think of :b

## newest android version

you can download the newest android version on [sammobile](https://www.sammobile.com/firmwares/).\
some might just be unaccessible, probably from age.\
**You do require to have a sammobile account**\
this one not only updates your phone to its heightest version possible, it also allows you to save your phone if needed.

## You want to install first the TWRP 

you have to download the TWRP for specific devices if you wanna root a phone/tablet.\
[Download it here](https://www.androidsage.com/2016/03/06/download-latest-twrp-3-0-0-for-your-android-device/)\
you wanna download the latest ".img.tar" file.

## what to root first
you first wanna root your phone specificly on TWRP only.\
and restart the phone using the TWRP, **IMPORTANT DON'T DELETE ANYTHING YET**.\
just retart it simply.\
You want to have some SSD card on your phone holding the .zip folder for the operation system on it inside your phone.\
Then you wanna go on the TWRP (as usual you need a specific button combination that you have to search up on internet.)
