# How to boot your devices on Lineage

## Tutorial by pascal

### Why should i download lineage?

Because lineage is a skeletonised android version, it does not contain google spying software.\
Googles constant Scanning for information will slow your phone tromendiously and so will your internet and hotspot. I strongly recommand using it on your Hotspot phone.\
Also in general, if youre sick that your data gets sent so somewhere you never wanted it to be, using lineage is a good solution.\
**IMPORTANT: some apps will not work anymore as APK specificly. It is a good variant for peoples with slightly more APK knowledge**

### Is it risky or illegal?

It certainly has a risk of fucking up the phone but its under 10% the chance to fuck it up\
Tho, you can always reboot it on the [normal settings using this site](https://www.sammobile.com/firmwares/)\
**Booting your phone is legal on Androids** since they actually belong to you in contrary to **Apple which is illegal** since the company still has all rights over your phone #don't_buy_apple_products.\

### Does this tutorial work for other Operation Systems?

Yes it does, we have a couple of good Googleless Operation Systems that you can use instead.\
\
[1. Lineage](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/)\
[2. crDroid](https://crdroid.net/downloads)\
[3. OmniRom](https://omnirom.org/#devices)\
[4. CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/install/) Only for Pixel

### What applications can i use on this?

well so we have an app called "F-droid" which allows you to download googlefree apps.\
