# bootloader
A bootloader is a background system that is here to start Operation Systems.
So lets make an example\
We use a Nintendo DS as an example so you understand best what a bootloader is\
**Note this isn't a bootloader, its just something you can imagine it being**\
![Example](https://github.com/pascal-gerber/Lineage-help/blob/main/Bootloader.jpg)\
A bootloader is usually locked for only Android Firmware so you need a [Key](https://twrp.me/) to unlock it.\
The key is for every phone type different, so is the bootloader.\
![Example](https://github.com/pascal-gerber/Lineage-help/blob/main/TWRP.jpg)\
### **VERY IMPORTANT! DO NOT WIPE THE "RECOVERY"**
in the recovery theres the operation system, do not wipe it off, else, youre screwled.\
\
Anyways, thats what a bootloader is.\
